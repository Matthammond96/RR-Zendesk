## HTML File
Used as a basic interface test different endpoints and there responses.

## AJAX JS File
Contains a basic fetch function with promises and error catching.

## Node App
The node App is a basic API endpoint which we used to test CORS responses as we faced Auth errors. I built the basic app to see what data was being sent to the endpoints as I noticed a difference between the chrome console and the server response.

## Product Liquid File
Show case the product liquid file currently used. Our theme is built using slate so is modular.
